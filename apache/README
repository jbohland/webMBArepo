To use Django with Apache, there are a number of steps that have to be followed.

1) Make sure mod_wsgi is installed. It is easily obtainable via yum or apt-get.

2) Create the django.wsgi file from the template in this directory. It is a small stub application
that is used to act as the bridge between Apache and our application. It has further detailed
instructions in its comments.

3) Update the appropriate httpd.conf with the directives in the conf template in the directory.
If you aren't using virtual hosts or other more complicated configurations, it may simply be
possible to copy the template file to /etc/httpd/conf.d/ (on Fedora), then restart Apache.

4) Comment out the static content handler line in urls.py. Also, if you decide to have a separate 
production copy in a different location, you will need to update the template location path to the
new one. Make sure that whereever the project directory is, it is not under the Apache server's
DocumentRoot.

For example, my directory stucture looks like this:
byrongalbraith.com/
byrongalbraith.com/html
byrongalbraith.com/logs
byrongalbraith.com/mba

I have the DocumentRoot pointing at html, while the Django project is in the mba directory.
